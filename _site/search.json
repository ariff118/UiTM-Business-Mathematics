A sequence can either be a finite set of numbers or an infinite set of numbers. A sequence is said to be infinite if there exist no end values and the numbers can continues infinitely. On the other hand, a finite is such that the set of numbers has and end value or stop at certain length. In this chapter, students will be introduced to two type of sequence; Arithmetic Sequence and Geometric Sequence. For both types, students will be exposed on the concepts of the \\(n^{th}\\ term\\) of a sequence and the \\(sum\\ of\\ the\\ first\\) \\(n^{th}\\ term\\) of a sequence. Finally, students will be exposed on how to apply the concepts of arithmetic and geometric sequences to some common problems in daily life."

    "text": "Background\nWhen we talk about interest, it can be in two scenarios whether you earned money from the certain amount of money you invested or you paid money for a certain amount of money you borrowed. Thus, interest can be defined as either money earned or paid from investment or loan amount made, respectively.\nSimple interest is the interest due at the end of a term. In simple interest transaction, only the principal (original value) will earn the interest. The principal can be the amount of money deposited in an account or the amount of money borrowed.\nThe amount of interest due at the end of a term depends on the principal, the length of the term and the rate of interest. The rate is usually given in percent and often as annual rate. The time is usually measured in years or a fraction of a year.\n\nSimple interest formula\nThe formula to find the interest \\((I)\\) due at interest rate \\(r\\%\\) for a principal \\(P\\) for a length of \\(t\\) years is\n\\[\nI\\ =\\ Prt\n\\]\nIn calculation, \\(r\\%\\) is converted to decimal number. For example, if the interest rate is 5%, then we will substitute \\(r\\) with \\(0.05\\).\n\n\nSimple amount formula\nThe future value \\((S)\\) is the total amount received or due at the end of the term. This is sometimes called as the simple amount.\nTo find the simple amount \\(S\\), the following formula can be used.\n$$\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nS\\ &=\\ P\\ +\\ I \\\\\n&=\\ P\\ +\\ Prt \\\\\n\nThus,\\ \\\\\nS\\ &=\\ P(1\\ +\\ rt)\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n$$\nNote: The value \\(t\\) in both formula above must be in years. Hence, for any period given not in years, it must be converted into years. For example, if the period is in months, then \\(t\\ =\\ \\frac{number\\ of\\ month}{12}\\)."

    "text": "Four Basics Concepts of Interest\nSometimes the duration or term period is given in the form of the time between one date to another. For example, certain amount of money was invested in a mutual fund on \\(3^{rd}\\ January,\\ 2020\\) will mature on the \\(28^{th}\\ April,\\ 2020\\). Thus, there are ways to calculate the \\(t\\) value based on the for concepts mentioned below.\n\nExact time and approximate time\n\nWhen dates are given, the number of days between the two dates is calculated in two ways. Those two ways are exact time and approximate time.\n\nExact time, as the name suggested, is the exact number of days as in the calendar between two dates given.\nApproximate time is found by assuming each month is 30 days flat.\n\n\nOrdinary simple interest and exact simple interest\n\nThere are two ways in which interest is calculated, namely the exact simple interest and the ordinary simple interest.\n\nExact interest is calculated based on 365 days a year, and for a leap year, using 366 days.\nOrdinary interest is calculated using a 360 days a year. It is using an approximation that each month having 30 days. This is to simplify computing and of course it increases the amount of interest due to the lender.\n\n\nBanker’s Rule\nOf the four ways to compute simple interest, the most popular is that of ordinary interest for the exact number of days. Being the common practice of the bank, it is popularly known as the Banker’s Rule. Of the four methods, this yields the maximum interest in any transaction.\n\\[\nBanker's\\ Rule\\ =\\ \\frac{Exact\\ Time}{360}\n\\]\nNOTE: Unless otherwise stated, we will use the Banker’s Rule in computing interest problems from here onwards."

    "text": "How does it work?\nConsider the following situation.\n\nMeet Chris. He is your loan officer. The bank where he works is willing to loan you money so you can purchase a building for your growing business. Of course, Chris won’t just hand you the RM500,000 in cash you need to purchase the building. That would be foolish, for how would Chris know that he would get that borrowed money back from you?\nWhat Chris does is to write up a promissory note for you. This note is a promise of payment. Once you sign this note, you agree to pay back the money along with any additional fees involved by a specific date.\n\n\nTerms\nThis promissory note that Chris has you sign is not just a sticky note saying that you will pay back the RM500,000 at some time in the future. This note goes into detail. It contains the terms or conditions that you will follow to pay back this large amount. It includes the interest rate that the bank charges you for borrowing money. This is how the bank makes money off of this transaction. It also includes the payment’s terms, such as when you are going to make payments and when the final payment will be made and the loan fully paid off.\nIn exchange for this loan, the bank also will keep the deed of ownership to the building until your loan is paid off. This is also specified in the promissory note. Once your loan is paid off, then the bank will give you the deed of ownership. But until then, the bank owns the building. This provides the bank with security in case you end up not paying them back.\nYou might see your promissory note written like this:\n\nAmount: RM500,000\n\nDate: Today\n\nInterest Rate: 5% annually\n\nPayment Amount: RM2,684.11 due the first of each month\n\nPayoff Date: 30 years from today\n\nThis promissory note is telling you that you have 30 years to pay off this loan. If you make a payment of RM2,684.11 every month for 30 years, you will have paid off your loan at the end of 30 years. This amount includes the annual interest rate of five percent."

    "section": "Bank Discount",
    "text": "Bank Discount\nIt is a common practice by the bank to deduct charges from a loan in advance. This charges is called bank discount. Note that in bank discount it is different from the case of simple interest. In simple interest, the amount of maturity value is more than the amount borrowed. In addition, normally in the beginning you have an amount that eventually will be more after certain time period, such that the present value is lower than the future value. However, in bank discount it is the other way around. Thus, in bank discount, the amount borrowed is actually the maturity value, not the principal or the present value.\nConsider a scenario where you borrow RM10,000 for 6 months from a bank that charged you a bank discount at a rate of 5% per annum. In this case, 5% of RM10,000 is RM500. So, the bank will deduct RM500 from the amount of loan RM10,000 in advance. Hence, you will only received RM9,500 from the loan you made with the bank.\nThus,\n\nThe money that the bank deduct in advanced is called Bank Discount - D = RM500\n\nThe money left receives by the borrower is called Proceeds - Proceeds = RM9,500\n\nThe maturity value is the value of the money actually borrowed - S = RM10,000\n\nSo,\n\n\nMaturity value = Proceeds + Bank Discount\n\nTo calculate the Bank Discount and Proceeds, we will use the following formula:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nD\\ &=\\ Sdt \\\\\n\\\\\nwhere,\\ D\\ &=\\ Bank\\ discount \\\\\n        d\\ &=\\ discount\\ rate \\\\\n        t\\ &=\\ term\\ of\\ discount\\ in\\ years. \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nand,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nProceeds,\\ H\\ &=\\ Maturity\\ value\\ –\\ Bank\\ discount\\\\                              \n             H\\ &=\\ S\\ –\\ D\\\\\n             H\\ &=\\ S\\ –\\ Sdt\\\\\n             H\\ &=\\ S( 1 -  dt)\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSometimes, bank charged for their service with simple interest rate in mind. So, they will find the equivalent discount (service charge) rate to the intended simple interest rate that they want to obtain. Below are the two formulas that can be used to calculate these rates.\n\\[\nr\\ =\\ \\frac{d}{1\\ -\\ dt}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ and\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ d\\ =\\ \\frac{r}{1\\ +\\ rt}\n\\]"

Since you don’t have that much money, a bank offers a loan, 90% of the cash price at certain interest rate paid through equal payment for certain duration of time. Thus, in this case you will have to pay the developer 10% of the cash price as down payment, while the balance 90% will be paid by the bank to the developer for the remaining amount. All you need to do now is to repay the loan to the bank by instalment.\n\nHere we have,\nDown Payment (DP) = % x Cash Price (CP) = 10% x 250,000 = 25,000 Balance (A) = CP – DP = 250,000 – 25,000 = RM 225,000 <– This is the amount that you have to loan from a bank\nTwo (2) important comcepts to remember:\n\nWhen you have late payments –> use formula \\(S\\) (keywords: failed to pay or arrears).\n\nWhen you want to pay early –> use formula \\(A\\) (keywords: settle the debt/loan immediately)."

    "text": "Markup\nTo calculate her markup, Shalon needs to take into consideration things like the cost of her time spent designing the shirts, the cost to manufacture the shirt, and the cost of keeping the store open. After all these costs are calculated, then she needs to figure out how much more she needs to add so she can make a good living from her t-shirt business.\nSay, for instance, after considering all the factors we mentioned, that the total cost to make each shirt for Shalon is RM10. Of course, Shalon wants to make a profit from selling each shirt, so she marks up her shirt price to RM30. How much of a markup is this? Let’s calculate it. RM30 is RM20 more than RM10. So dividing RM20 by RM10, we get 20/10 = 2. Changing this into a percentage, we see that Shalon has a markup of 200%.\nShalon wants to make sure she is competitive with other t-shirt businesses in town, so she does some investigating of her own. She visits another shop and she finds that this shop has a markup of 100%. If the manufacturing cost of the product is RM10, how much is this shop selling the shirts for?\nWe can calculate this by multiplying the RM10 with the 100% to find how much our increase is. Changing the 100% to a decimal, we get 1 for our decimal. Multiplying the 10 with the 1, we find that this shop has increased their prices by RM10 per shirt. So the shirts here cost RM10 + RM10 = RM20.\nHmm, Shalon is thinking that her prices might be a bit steep for the customers in the neighborhood based on her investigations."

To calculate this, we first see how much of a difference we have. We have a difference of RM30 - RM20 = RM10. So, the markdown is RM10/RM30 = 0.3333 or roughly 33%.\nShalon can do this two ways. She can either offer a 33% off coupon to all her customers or she can decrease her prices without offering coupons. Even if she sells a shirt for RM20, she is still making profit."

    "text": "What is depreciation?\n\nDefinition:\nDepreciation is defined as the loss in value of capital assets such as vehicles, machinery tools and equipment due to usage over time.\n\nThus, in general the term depreciation refers to fall in the value or utility of fixed assets which are used in operations over the definite period of years. In other words, depreciation is the process of spreading the cost of fixed assets over the number of years during which benefit of the asset is received.\nThe fall in value or utility of fixed assets due to so many causes like wear and tear, decay, effluxion of time or obsolescence, replacement, breakdown, fall in market value etc.\nThe following factors are to be considered while charging the amount of depreciation:\n1. The original cost of the asset.\n2. The useful life of the asset.\n3. Estimated scrap or residual value of the asset at the end of its life.\n4. Selecting an appropriate method of depreciation.\nSome of the important terms in depreciation are:\nOriginal cost (C) : The cost paid for the item including any sales tax, transportation charges, installation charges and other cost that incurred.\nSalvage cost (S) : Cost at the end of its lifetime. It is also called scrap-value or trade-in-value or junkyard.\nUseful life (n) : life expectancy or the number of years the asset is expected to last. Sometimes called as economic life.\nBook value (BV) : The difference between the original cost and the accumulated depreciation to that date. May also refer as the market value or market price of an asset at certain years.\nTotal depreciation : difference between original cost and the salvage value.\nAnnual depreciation : the amount of depreciation in a year.\nAccumulated depreciation : the total depreciation to date."

Declining Balance Method\n\nStraight Line Method\nThis method is also termed as Constant Charge Method. Under this method, depreciation is charged for every year will be the constant amount throughout the life of the asset.\nAccordingly depreciation is calculated by deducting the scrap value from the original cost of an asset and the balance is divided by the number of years estimated as the life of the asset.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nAnnual\\ Depreciation,\\ AD &=\\ \\frac{Total\\ Cost(C) - Salvage\\ Value(S)}{Useful\\ Life(n)}\\\\\n\\\\\nwhere\\ ,\\ n\\ &=\\ useful\\ life\\\\\nC\\ &=\\ Cost\\\\\nS\\ &=\\ Salvage\\ Value\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nExample\nConsider a piece of equipment that costs RM25,000 with an estimated useful life of 6 years and a RM6,250 salvage value. The depreciation expense per year for this equipment would be as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nC &= 25,000 \\\\\nS &= 6,250 \\\\\nn &= 6 \\\\\n\\\\\nAD &= \\frac{25,000 - 6,250}{6} \\\\\n&= 3,125\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe following table illustrate the depreciation process using straight line method:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear (\\(n\\))\nOpening Book Value\nAnnual Depreciation (\\(AD\\))\nAccumulated Depreciation (\\(AcD_n\\))\nEnding Book Value (\\(BV_n\\))\n\n\n\n\n0\n-\n-\n-\n25,000\n\n\n1\n25,000\n3,125\n3,125\n21,875\n\n\n2\n21,875\n3,125\n6,250\n18,750\n\n\n3\n18,750\n3,125\n9,375\n15,625\n\n\n4\n15,625\n3,125\n12,500\n12,500\n\n\n5\n12,500\n3,125\n15,625\n9,375\n\n\n6\n9,375\n3,125\n18,750\n6,250\n\n\n\nSome of the important formula that comes with this method are;\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nAnnual\\ Rate\\ of\\ Depreciation &= \\frac{Annual\\ Depreciation}{Total\\ Depreciation} * 100\\% \\\\\n&= \\frac{AD}{TD} * 100\\%\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nor, can also use the following formula,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nAnnual\\ Rate\\ of\\ Depreciation &= \\frac{1}{Useful\\ Life} * 100\\% \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{n} * 100\\%\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTo find the Book Value at certain period, BV_n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nBook\\ Value(BV_n) &= Cost\\ -\\ Accumulated\\ Depreciation\\\\\n&= C\\ -\\ nAD\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\nDeclining Balance Method\nThe declining balance method produces the highest depreciation charges in the earlier years of the asset.
